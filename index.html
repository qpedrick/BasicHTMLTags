    <h1>Hello!  My name is Quinton Ulysses Pedrick and I'm happy you're here!</h1>

    <h2>So where should we start?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lets get to know a little about me!</li>
        <li>Wanna see some art, kid?</li>
        <li>Why am I such a procrastinator?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <p>Well that's an interesting question now, isn't it?</p>
    <p>I grew up in Chicago and Northwest Indiana, went to Purdue, dropped out to live in California and Colorado, and recently moved to Indianapolis from Michigan.</p>
    <p>I managed hotels in Southwest Michigan and since moving to Indianapolis I have joined a coworking space called <a href="https://speakeasyindy.com"target="_blank">The SpeakEasy</a></p>
